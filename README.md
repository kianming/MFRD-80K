MFRD-80K: A Dataset for Masked Face Recognition

A masked face dataset with 80,500 images of 161 subjects was collected, referred to as Masked Face Recognition Dataset-80K (MFRD-80K). The masked face images were captured via smartphone/webcam camera in varying backgrounds thus posing more challenges to the recognition tasks. The masked face dataset can be used for face recognition or verification purposes.
