# MFRD-80K: A Dataset for Masked Face Recognition

A masked face dataset with 80,500 images of 161 subjects was collected, referred to as Masked Face Recognition Dataset-80K (MFRD-80K). The masked face images were captured via smartphone/webcam camera in varying backgrounds thus posing more challenges to the recognition tasks. The masked face dataset can be used for face recognition or verification purposes. All images were resized to the resolution of 192 Ã— 256. For each subject, the masked face images were randomly partitioned into train, validation, and test set at the ratio of 60:20:20. There are a total of 48,300, 16,100 and 16,100 images in the train, validation, and test set.
